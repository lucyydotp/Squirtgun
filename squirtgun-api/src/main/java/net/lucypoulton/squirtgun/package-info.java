/**
 * Squirtgun is a general-purpose, cross-platform Minecraft Java edition library,
 * designed to make plugin development a little easier. Originally known as LucyCommonLib,
 * named after the original author, it's now been updated beyond all recognition and is
 * slightly less crappy.
 * <br>
 * <br>
 * Squirtgun is designed to be platform-agnostic - if there's an implementation available
 * for a certain platform, your code will run on it. It makes use of popular libraries like
 * Kyori's Adventure to handle rich text. Everything else has been written to be simple and
 * similar to existing APIs while also being flexible and powerful. Also builders because
 * normal constructors are for boring people.
